abstract: |
  We present the Ultrasonic Consciousness Hypothesis, proposing that the systematic
  removal of ultrasonic frequencies (20-96kHz) through lossy audio compression since
  the 1990s may have inadvertently eliminated crucial emotional grounding mechanisms
  in human consciousness. Through empirical analysis of 192kHz vinyl recordings
  revealing 58,416 temporal resonances with Fibonacci correlations of 0.85-0.88,
  combined with the Marine Algorithm's O(1) jitter-based salience detection, we
  identify three distinct types of spectral fractures: dynamic fractures from
  loudness normalization, spectral fractures from frequency truncation, and
  perceptual fractures from engineered emotional responses. This paper introduces
  a theoretical framework for understanding audio as a complete consciousness
  substrate and presents evidence suggesting that two decades of compressed audio
  consumption represents an unprecedented experiment in human consciousness modification.
